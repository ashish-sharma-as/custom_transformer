#### About:

This project uses sklearn's custom transformers to automate the preprocessing of data across datasets. Since this is easily integrated within sklearn's pipieline module, it forms a powerful feature to use for any custom preprocessing one might need before feeding their data into their ML models.

This project uses simple data to illustrate the following
* How to create and use a custom transformer
* Compare its output with sklearn-pandas DataFrameMapper
